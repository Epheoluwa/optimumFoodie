                            <li>Follow this plan as strictly as you can. Do not eat anything outside what is stipulated per day, even if you feel it is healthy. Check in with me if you want to swap any food for another. Your success is very dependent on how well you follow this plan.</li>
                            <li>Be very strict with how you measure your oil. Oil is not your friend, never “use your eyes” to measure, use your spoons to measure all the time. It is very easy to overestimate. Don’t get me wrong, oil isn’t bad, but your body needs only little.</li>

                        <h3>How to Stay Full</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Drink a glass of water before and after each meal, to keep you full. This is very important! Target at least three 75cl bottles a day.</li>
                            <li>Zero calorie drinks such as Zero coke, Pepsi light, Cream soda are allowed, if you badly crave a soft drink.</li>
                            <li>Eat as much vegetables as you like with your meals to keep you full. It should be a lot more than your carbs, fill your plate with them.</li>
                            <li>You can have extra portions of vegetables like garden eggs, carrots and cucumbers. They are low calorie.</li>
                        </ul><br>

                        <h3>When to Eat</h3>
                        <p>Firstly, the idea that you need to eat breakfast or eat your last meal by 7pm are simply untrue. Throw that idea out the window. When it comes to timing of your meals here’s what’s really important:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eat before you actually get hungry</li>
                            <li>Try to stay consistent with your eating schedule on a day-to-day basis.</li>
                            <li>As for when to “stop eating”, have you last meal at least 2hrs before you lay down to sleep. This is NOT because your food stores as fat at night, that’s not true. I’m asking you to give the 2hr gap to prevent gastrointestinal issues like reflux or heart burns. So if you sleep around 12am for example, you can delay your dinner till around 10pm.</li>
                            <li>What happens if you decide to skip breakfast? Nothing! It’s fine. You can also choose to add some elements of the breakfast you missed into the next meal. For example, let’s assume you were supposed to have fruits with some chicken, you could choose to add the chicken from the breakfast to your lunch.</li>
                        </ul><br>

                        <h3 style="margin-top: 10rem;">Meal Preparation</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your oil options include: olive oil, sesame oil, soya oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, corn oil, safflower oil</li>
                            <li>Please do not fry your chicken, fish, snails, prawns and so on.. You can boil, grill, roast or smoke.</li>
                            <li>Try to get all your groceries during the weekend, in preparation for the week.</li>
                            <li>I advise making meals in bulk and pre-packing them in your fridge. Cook your protein and vegetables in bulk and keep in the freezer.</li>
                            <li>I also advise chopping vegetables needed for certain meals and shredding your coleslaw over the weekend. Chopping or shredding helps keep them fresh and saves plenty of time during the week. Keep them in freezer bags in your REFRIGERATOR</li>
                            <li>You’ll need the food measuring cups to measure certain foods, as outlined in your meal plan. Here’s what they look like below. </li>

                        <h3>Recording your Result</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take your weight and measurements every Saturday morning. Take your readings first thing in the morning, before eating or drinking anything. If you feel like moving your bowel, do so before taking your measurements. </li>
                            <li>Record your readings side-by side similar to the photo below. Please note that your weight might not move on some weeks, but as long as your inches are shrinking, then you are sure you are making progress! </li>
                            <li>Don’t forget to also celebrate your non-scale victories, success is more than just numbers! </li>
